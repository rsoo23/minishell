
Parsing

1. Search for <<, get limiter 
2. Search for <, get infile_fd
3. Search for > or >>, get outfile_fd

Tests
1. Simple commands
    - [x] echo
    - [x] echo -n
    - [x] ls -l -a -h
    - [x] cd ../Documents/Core

2. Only Pipes: cmd | cmd | cmd | ...
    - [x] ls -la | wc -w 
    - [x] ls -la | wc -w | cat | cat 

3. Both < and >: cmd < infile.txt | cmd | ... | ... > outfile.txt
    - [x] ls -la > outfile.txt
    - [ ] cat > outfile.txt -e
    - [x] sort < infile.txt
    - [x] sort < infile.txt | ls -l 
    - [x] sort < infile.txt | ls -l | cat 
    - [x] grep hi < infile.txt | ls -l | cat > outfile.txt

4. Both << and >>: cmd << limiter | cmd | ... | ... >> outfile.txt
    - [x] ls -la >> outfile
    - [x] << limiter
    - [x] cmd << limiter
    - [x] cmd << limiter >> outfile
    - [x] cmd << limiter | cmd >> outfile

5. <>: receive input from file, output to STDOUT
    - [x] wc -wl <> main.c

ls -la << stop | wc -w >> outfile
tokenizer:
ls
-la
<<
stop
|
wc 
-w
>>
outfile

parse:
[<< stop]
[ls -la]
[wc -w]
[>> outfile]

[<< stop]
[>> outfile]
[ls -la]
[wc -w]
