1. Search for <<, get limiter 
2. Search for <, get infile_fd

Tests
1. Only Pipes: cmd | cmd | cmd | ...

2. Both < and >: cmd < infile.txt | cmd | ... | ... > outfile.txt
grep "pattern" < input.txt | wc -l

3. Both << and >>: cmd << limiter | cmd | ... | ... >> outfile.txt

    - << limiter
    - cmd << limiter
    - cmd << limiter >> outfile
    - cmd << limiter | cmd >> outfile
